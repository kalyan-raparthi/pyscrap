ADDITIONAL LEARNING LEADING TO
UG DEGREE WITH HONOURS / MINOR IN ENGINEERING

( In line with the provisions laid down in AICTE Model Curriculum for Undergraduate Degree Course in Engineering & Technology, January 2018)




Every student has specific abilities, interests, career goals and wishes to enhance his/her academic learning experience. Employers look for graduates with different combinations of competencies with T-shaped skills. Hence, opportunities for additional learning are the major requirement for students to bridge the industry-academia gap.

At KITSW, to support students’ additional learning needs, the following provisions are made in URR18 curriculum:

HONOURS
          MINOR IN ENGINEERING

A student will be eligible to get UG Degree with Honours in one’s own discipline and/or additional Minor in Engineering in a discipline other than one’s own, if he/she completes an additional 20 credits, in addition to basic degree 160 credit requirement. These additional 20 credits could be acquired through MOOCs.

Interested KITSW students can earn required additional credits leading to Honours/Minor in Engineering. Detailed guidelines for the additional learning are here.
